## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in providing readers and anime lovers with answers to questions like:
1. What are the most watched animes?
2. What anime movies are suitable for the various seasons we have in a year?
3. What genre do most persons like watching?
4. Which studio produces the best rated movies?
Answers to these questions will help anime watchers in choosing the right anime for them.

## File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the questions posed above. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available <a href=''>here</a>.
